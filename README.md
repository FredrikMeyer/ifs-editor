# IFS Editor

Inspired by [this page](http://paulbourke.net/fractals/ifs/).

## Ideas / links

### Fractal Flame Algorithm

[Fractal Flame Algorithm](https://flam3.com/flame_draves.pdf)

Would want to implement the ideas in this paper. 

### Larry Riddle's home page

[Link](https://larryriddle.agnesscott.org/ifs/ifs.htm)

Nice pictures and explanations.

### IFS Construction Kit

Larry Riddle's [program](https://larryriddle.agnesscott.org/ifskit/gallery/gallery.htm).

Would be interesting to parse his IFS file format.

### Use WASM + Rust for drawing to Canvas?

See this [Julia set example](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/examples/julia.html).

Or perhaps AssemblyScript? Example [here](https://www.assemblyscript.org/examples/interference.html).

### TODOS

 - Add animation on parameters (i.e. let a parameter animate from 0 to max value)
 - Save nice fractals
 - Support for other fractals than IFS
 - Tighter UI (components are a bit big now, less clicking)
